Create resource file

"BINARY" resource with name 161 contains position and size of the loading chunks that need to be drawn.
It are 18 lines in total in the format  xPos, yPos, xSize, ySize

Bitmap data
19 resources containing the images to be used in 32bits ARGB format, the headertype MUST be BITMAPINFOHEADER (headersize = 40) for it to work correctly !!!
Check https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP_file_format for more info.

I got this result by exporting a file in GIMP as a .bmp 32bit ARGB format WITHOUT color data (see advanced settings when saving).
After that open the .bmp in the default Windows Paint (not Paint 3D) and just save it again.

Resource names are
140 Initial Splash
143-160 => Loading sections to draw
